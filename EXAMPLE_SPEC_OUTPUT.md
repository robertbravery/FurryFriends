# Example: What /spec Command Generates

## Example 1: Booking Cancellation Feature

**Command**:
```bash
speckai spec "Add booking cancellation and rescheduling functionality"
```

**Generated Output** (`specs/001-booking-cancellation/spec.md`):

```markdown
# Feature Specification: Booking Cancellation and Rescheduling

**Feature Branch**: `001-booking-cancellation`
**Created**: 2025-10-04
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "Add booking cancellation and rescheduling functionality"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a client, I want to cancel or reschedule my pet walking booking so that 
I can adjust my plans without losing my entire payment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a confirmed booking 48 hours in the future, **When** client 
   cancels, **Then** full refund is issued and pet walker is notified
2. **Given** a confirmed booking 12 hours in the future, **When** client 
   cancels, **Then** 50% cancellation fee is charged and pet walker is notified
3. **Given** a confirmed booking, **When** client requests reschedule and 
   pet walker has availability, **Then** booking is moved to new time slot
4. **Given** a confirmed booking, **When** client requests reschedule but 
   pet walker has no availability, **Then** error message is shown with 
   alternative dates

### Edge Cases
- What happens when client cancels after booking has started?
- How does system handle rescheduling to a date when pet walker is unavailable?
- What if pet walker cancels the booking?
- How are partial refunds calculated for multi-day bookings?

## What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Review the Generated Spec

```bash
# Open the generated spec
code specs/001-booking-cancellation/spec.md
```

### Step 2: Resolve [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers

Look for lines like:
```markdown
[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: refund method - original payment method, account credit, or both?]
```

Replace with your decision:
```markdown
Refunds will be issued to original payment method within 5-7 business days
```

### Step 3: Add Missing Details

Based on your BRD, add:
- Cancellation policy specifics (24 hours = full refund, etc.)
- Who can cancel (client only or both parties)
- Notification requirements
- Any business rules from your domain

### Step 4: Remove [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] Markers

Once resolved, delete the marker text so the spec is clean.

### Step 5: Mark Spec as Ready

Update the status:
```markdown
**Status**: Ready for Planning
```

## üéØ Recommended First Feature from Your BRD

Based on your BRD and current implementation, I recommend starting with:

### **Option A: Booking Cancellation** (Easiest)
- ‚úÖ Small, well-defined scope
- ‚úÖ Builds on existing Booking aggregate
- ‚úÖ Clear business rules
- ‚úÖ No new aggregates needed

**Command**:
```bash
speckai spec "Add booking cancellation functionality. Clients can cancel bookings with cancellation fees: 24+ hours before = full refund, less than 24 hours = 50% fee. Pet walker receives notification. Cancelled bookings cannot be reactivated. Cancellation reason is optional."
```

### **Option B: Review & Rating System** (Medium)
- ‚úÖ Well-defined in BRD (sections 2.1, 2.2, 3.6)
- ‚úÖ New aggregate (good learning experience)
- ‚úÖ Clear user value
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires new entities

**Command**:
```bash
speckai spec "Add review and rating system. Clients rate pet walkers 1-5 stars after completed bookings with optional comments. Pet walkers can respond to reviews. Average rating displayed on profiles. Only completed bookings can be reviewed, one review per booking."
```

code specs/001-feature-name/spec.md

# 4. Fill in [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers

# 5. Update status to "Ready for Planning"

# 6. Run plan command

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Start Small**: Pick one feature from BRD, not multiple
2. **Be Specific**: More detail in spec command = better output
3. **Use BRD Language**: Copy exact requirements from your BRD
4. **Resolve Clarifications**: Don't skip [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
5. **Constitution Check**: The /plan command will validate against your v2.0.0 rules

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Try this right now**:

```bash
cd c:\Users\rbrav\source\repos\FurryFriends

speckai spec "Add booking cancellation functionality for FurryFriends. Clients can cancel confirmed bookings through the BookingManagement page. Cancellation policy: bookings cancelled 24+ hours before start time receive full refund, bookings cancelled less than 24 hours before start time incur 50% cancellation fee. Pet walker receives email notification when booking is cancelled. Booking status changes from Confirmed to Cancelled. Clients can optionally provide cancellation reason. Cancelled bookings cannot be reactivated."
```

This will create your first spec file, and you can see exactly how Spec-Kit works with your solution!
