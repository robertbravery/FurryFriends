# Feature Specification: Booking Cancellation

**Feature Branch**: `002-add-booking-cancellation`
**Created**: 2025-10-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Add booking cancellation functionality that allows clients and pet walkers to cancel existing bookings with appropriate status transitions, validation rules, and audit logging. The system should prevent cancellation of completed or already-cancelled bookings, maintain booking history for audit purposes, and provide clear feedback to users about cancellation success or failure. Cancellations should be logged for business analytics and potential future refund processing."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors (clients, pet walkers), actions (cancel bookings), data (booking status, cancellation reason, audit logs), constraints (cannot cancel completed/cancelled bookings)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚Üí Booking, Cancellation, AuditLog
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-19
- Q: What is the allowed time window for cancellations before the booking start time, and what are the associated charges or penalties? ‚Üí A: 24 hours, no penalty, 12 hours, 20% penalty, 6 hours, 40% penalty, 3 hours, 60% penalty, 1 hour, 100% penalty

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

---
- Q: If payment is processed, how is refund issued? ‚Üí A: Credit to client's account

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*
- Q: How will system ensure only authorized users cancel bookings? ‚Üí A: Both of the above

### Primary User Story
As a client or pet walker, I want to be able to cancel a booking so that I can manage my schedule and avoid unnecessary charges or commitments.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a booking exists with status "Confirmed", **When** a client cancels the booking, **Then** the booking status changes to "Cancelled" and the client receives a cancellation confirmation.
2. **Given** a booking exists with status "Confirmed", **When** a pet walker cancels the booking, **Then** the booking status changes to "Cancelled" and the client and pet walker receive a cancellation confirmation.
3. **Given** a booking exists with status "Completed", **When** a client or pet walker attempts to cancel the booking, **Then** the system prevents the cancellation and displays an error message.
4. **Given** a booking exists with status "Cancelled", **When** a client or pet walker attempts to cancel the booking, **Then** the system prevents the cancellation and displays an error message.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the cancellation occurs close to the booking start time? Cancellations are allowed up to 24 hours before the booking start time with no penalty.
- How does the system handle concurrent cancellation requests from the client and pet walker? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Implement locking mechanism to prevent race conditions]
- What happens when the payment has already been processed? The refund will be issued as a credit to the client's account.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow clients and pet walkers to cancel bookings with status "Confirmed".
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent cancellation of bookings with status "Completed" or "Cancelled".
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain a booking history, including cancellation details, for audit purposes.
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear feedback to users about cancellation success or failure.
- **FR-005**: System MUST log all cancellation events for business analytics.
- **FR-006**: System MUST send cancellation confirmation to the client and pet walker.
- **FR-007**: System MUST record the cancellation reason provided by the user. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should there be a predefined list of reasons or free text?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that the user initiating the cancellation is either the client or the pet walker associated with the booking.
- **FR-009**: System MUST use Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and verify the user ID against the booking to authorize cancellation requests.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Booking**: Represents a scheduled pet walking service, including details such as date, time, location, client, pet walker, price, service type, and pet details.
- **Cancellation**: Represents a cancellation event, including details such as cancellation date, time, reason, and the user who initiated the cancellation.
- **AuditLog**: Represents a record of all booking-related events, including creation, updates, and cancellations, and includes the user, timestamp, booking ID, reason, and status of the cancellation.
