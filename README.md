## Project Overview

**FurryFriends** is a web API dedicated to managing pet care operations, including pet walking and overall pet management. The project is built with a clear separation of concerns to foster scalability, maintainability, and clarity. Key features include:

- **Fast Endpoints & Fluent Validation:** For streamlined HTTP request routing and robust input validation.
- **MediatR Integration:** For decoupled handling of commands, queries, and notifications.
- **EF Core & MS SQL:** Providing a reliable persistence layer with well-structured data access patterns.
- **Domain Integrity:** Implemented via Ardalis Guard Clauses and the Specification pattern (using Ardalis.Specifications) to enforce business rules.
- **Uniform Response Patterns:** Via the Ardalis.Results pattern, ensuring clear and consistent API responses.
- **Generic Repositories:** Utilizing the Ardalis Shared Kernel for consistent data access.
- **Cross-cutting Concerns:** Managed with a Global Exception Middleware and structured logging using Serilog integrated with Open Telemetry.
- **Robust Testing:** Covered by xUnit, Fluent Assertions, and Moq for confidence in code changes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0)
- [MS SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server)
- Your preferred IDE (Visual Studio, VS Code, JetBrains Rider, etc.)

### Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FurryFriends.git
cd FurryFriends

```

### Building the Application

Restore dependencies and build the solution:

```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, navigate to the API project directory and execute:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/FurryFriends.Api
```

The API will be running on your localhost (default: http://localhost:5000).

## Configuration & Deployment

### Configuration

- **Database:** Update your connection string in the `appsettings.json` file (or environment-specific configuration file) within the API project.
- **Logging & Telemetry:** Configure Serilog and Open Telemetry within the logging section in `appsettings.json`.

### Database Migrations

To apply the latest migrations with EF Core, navigate to the Infrastructure project directory and run:

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project src/FurryFriends.Infrastructure
```

### Deployment

FurryFriends can be deployed on any hosting environment that supports .NET. Ensure that your environment has the correct connection strings and that any necessary environment variables are configured properly.
