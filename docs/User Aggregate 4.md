In the context of your Pet Walking / Pet Care application, you're on the right track with including value objects like `PhoneNumber` and `Address` in the `User` aggregate. Since the `User` represents a pet walker in this case, you'll want to include relevant information that potential clients (pet owners) would look for when choosing a pet walker. Below are some additional attributes you can consider adding to the `User` aggregate to help improve the decision-making process for clients:

### Additional Information for the `User` Aggregate

1. **Photos**:
   - **Profile Photo**: This is often the first thing pet owners look for in a pet walker. It helps establish trust.
   - **Photos with Pets**: Pet owners may want to see pictures of the walker interacting with pets. This demonstrates experience and care with animals.
   
   ```csharp
   public List<Photo> Photos { get; private set; } = new List<Photo>();
   ```

2. **Testimonials / Reviews**:
   - Positive testimonials or reviews from previous clients are vital for building trust. It shows the pet walker’s reliability and quality of service.
   
   ```csharp
   public List<Testimonial> Testimonials { get; private set; } = new List<Testimonial>();
   ```

3. **Allergies**:
   - Knowing whether the walker has allergies to specific animals (e.g., cats, dogs, rabbits, etc.) can be critical. Pet owners may want a walker who is not allergic to the pets they own.
   
   ```csharp
   public List<string> Allergies { get; private set; } = new List<string>();
   ```

4. **Experience / Qualifications**:
   - This could include certifications, years of experience, or training related to pet care (e.g., First Aid for pets, dog training experience).
   
   ```csharp
   public string Qualifications { get; private set; } = string.Empty;
   public int YearsOfExperience { get; private set; }
   ```

5. **Availability**:
   - A pet walker’s availability is crucial. You can model this as a value object like `Availability` with time slots or a calendar.
   
   ```csharp
   public Availability Availability { get; private set; } = default!;
   ```

6. **Service Types / Specialization**:
   - Some pet walkers might specialize in certain types of pets, like dogs, cats, birds, etc. You might also want to know if they offer special services like training, medical assistance, or dog running.
   
   ```csharp
   public List<ServiceType> ServiceTypes { get; private set; } = new List<ServiceType>();
   ```

7. **Pricing**:
   - Pricing is a key factor in deciding whether to hire a walker. This can be part of your aggregate if the pricing model is fixed. If the pricing is dynamic, you can handle it in a service layer or separate value object.
   
   ```csharp
   public decimal HourlyRate { get; private set; }
   public List<RateCard> RateCards { get; private set; } = new List<RateCard>();
   ```

8. **Emergency Contact Info**:
   - Clients may want to know who to contact in case of an emergency. This could be another value object or a simple string.
   
   ```csharp
   public string EmergencyContact { get; private set; } = string.Empty;
   ```

9. **Background Check**:
   - A background check can be important to ensure that the pet walker has no criminal history, especially in a field where the safety of pets is a top priority.
   
   ```csharp
   public bool HasPassedBackgroundCheck { get; private set; }
   ```

10. **Languages Spoken**:
    - Clients may prefer a walker who speaks their language, especially in a multicultural environment. This can be useful for client-walker communication.
    
    ```csharp
    public List<string> LanguagesSpoken { get; private set; } = new List<string>();
    ```

11. **Insurance / Bonding**:
    - It could be useful to know if the pet walker is insured or bonded. This helps the pet owner feel secure about potential risks while their pet is in the walker’s care.
    
    ```csharp
    public bool IsInsured { get; private set; }
    public bool IsBonded { get; private set; }
    ```

12. **Pet Preferences**:
    - If a walker prefers certain types of pets or has restrictions, this could help match the right walker to the right pet. For example, a walker may be comfortable with large dogs but not with small, more fragile ones.
    
    ```csharp
    public List<string> PetPreferences { get; private set; } = new List<string>();
    ```

13. **Pet Care Philosophy**:
    - Clients may want to know the pet walker’s approach or philosophy when it comes to pet care, whether they emphasize exercise, play, discipline, or comfort.
    
    ```csharp
    public string PetCarePhilosophy { get; private set; } = string.Empty;
    ```

14. **Status**:
    - It can be helpful to know whether the walker is actively seeking clients or if they are fully booked. This status can affect how a client views their availability.
    
    ```csharp
    public UserStatus Status { get; private set; }
    ```

### Potential Domain Classes / Value Objects
In addition to adding properties to the `User` aggregate, you might also need to create new domain classes or value objects, such as:

- **Photo**: A value object that holds photo details like the URL or path, a description, and the type of photo (profile, action shot, etc.).
- **Testimonial**: This could be a value object with properties for the reviewer's name, rating, and the review text.
- **Availability**: A value object that includes the days and times the walker is available.
- **ServiceType**: This could be an enumeration or a class that defines the type of services provided (dog walking, pet sitting, etc.).
- **RateCard**: A value object for different rates depending on the type of service (e.g., hourly rate, flat rate, service type).

### Example Update to `User` Class

Here is an updated example for your `User` class incorporating some of these ideas:

```csharp
public class User : IAggregateRoot
{
    public Guid Id { get; private set; } = default!;
    public string Name { get; private set; } = default!;
    public string Email { get; private set; } = default!;
    public PhoneNumber PhoneNumber { get; private set; } = default!;
    public Address Address { get; private set; } = default!;
    public List<Photo> Photos { get; private set; } = new List<Photo>();
    public List<Testimonial> Testimonials { get; private set; } = new List<Testimonial>();
    public List<string> Allergies { get; private set; } = new List<string>();
    public string Qualifications { get; private set; } = string.Empty;
    public int YearsOfExperience { get; private set; }
    public Availability Availability { get; private set; } = default!;
    public List<ServiceType> ServiceTypes { get; private set; } = new List<ServiceType>();
    public decimal HourlyRate { get; private set; }
    public string EmergencyContact { get; private set; } = string.Empty;
    public bool HasPassedBackgroundCheck { get; private set; }
    public List<string> LanguagesSpoken { get; private set; } = new List<string>();
    public bool IsInsured { get; private set; }
    public bool IsBonded { get; private set; }
    public List<string> PetPreferences { get; private set; } = new List<string>();
    public string PetCarePhilosophy { get; private set; } = string.Empty;
    public UserStatus Status { get; private set; }
}
```

By adding these additional pieces of information, you will help create a rich aggregate that aligns with the needs of both the pet walkers and the pet owners, making it easier for pet owners to choose a walker that fits their needs.
