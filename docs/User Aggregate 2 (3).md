**In your User Aggregate for a Pet Walking/Pet Care application, consider these additions:**

**Essential Information for Pet Owners:**

* **Availability:**
    * **Working Hours:** Define daily/weekly availability (e.g., Monday-Friday 9am-5pm, Weekends available).
    * **Service Areas:** Specify the areas they cover (e.g., zip codes, neighborhoods, city/county). This is crucial for pet owners to find walkers near them.
    * **Service Radius:** If applicable, define the maximum distance they are willing to travel.
* **Experience:**
    * **Years of Experience:** How long have they been providing pet care services?
    * **Animal Experience:** List specific animal types (dogs, cats, reptiles, etc.) and breeds they have experience with.
    * **Specializations:** Highlight any specialized skills (e.g., dog training, grooming, elderly pet care, special needs care).
* **Pricing:**
    * **Pricing Model:** Define their pricing structure (e.g., per walk, per hour, package deals).
    * **Pricing Tiers:** Offer different pricing options based on service type (e.g., dog walking vs. dog sitting).

**Enhancing User Confidence:**

* **Photos:** 
    * **Profile Picture:** A professional headshot or friendly photo builds trust.
    * **Photos with Animals:** Showcasing them with animals they've cared for can be impactful.
* **Testimonials:**
    * **Client Reviews:** Include positive testimonials from previous clients (with their consent).
    * **Social Proof:** Consider integrating with platforms like Google Reviews for added credibility.
* **Insurance/Certification:** 
    * **Insurance Information:** Mention if they have pet sitter insurance or professional liability insurance.
    * **Certifications:** List any relevant certifications (e.g., CPR/First Aid for pets, dog training certifications).

**Important Considerations:**

* **Allergies:**
    * **Pet Allergies:** Include a field for the walker to list any pet allergies they have.
    * **Client Allergies:** Consider a field where clients can specify any allergies their pets have.
* **Personalization:**
    * **Bio/About Me:** Allow walkers to write a short bio about themselves and their passion for pets. 
    * **Services Offered:** Create a list of services they provide (e.g., dog walking, dog sitting, pet taxi, grooming, in-home visits).
