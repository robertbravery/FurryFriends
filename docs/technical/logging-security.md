# Logging Security Considerations

## Overview

This document outlines the security considerations for the logging architecture in the FurryFriends application. Proper logging is essential for security monitoring and auditing, but improper logging can itself become a security risk if sensitive information is exposed.

## Sensitive Information Handling

### Types of Sensitive Information

The following types of information should be considered sensitive and handled with care in logs:

1. **Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**
   - Full names
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers
   - Physical addresses
   - IP addresses
   - User IDs

2. **Authentication Information**
   - Passwords (even hashed)
   - Session tokens
   - API keys
   - Authentication cookies

3. **Financial Information**
   - Credit card numbers
   - Bank account details
   - Payment transaction IDs

4. **Health Information**
   - Pet medical history
   - Vaccination records
   - Health conditions

### Logging Guidelines for Sensitive Information

#### Data Minimization

Only log what is necessary for debugging, monitoring, and auditing purposes:

```csharp
// AVOID: Logging entire objects that may contain sensitive data
_logger.LogInformation("User data: {@UserData}", userData);

// BETTER: Log only necessary, non-sensitive information
_logger.LogInformation("User action completed for user ID {UserId}", userData.Id);
```

#### Data Masking

When sensitive data must be logged, use masking techniques:

```csharp
// AVOID: Logging email addresses directly
_logger.LogInformation("Email sent to {Email}", user.Email);

// BETTER: Mask sensitive parts of the email
_logger.LogInformation("Email sent to {Email}", MaskEmail(user.Email));

// Implementation example
private string MaskEmail(string email)
{
    var parts = email.Split('@');
    if (parts.Length != 2) return "[invalid-email]";
    
    var name = parts[0];
    var domain = parts[1];
    
    if (name.Length <= 2) return name[0] + "***@" + domain;
    return name[0] + "***" + name[name.Length - 1] + "@" + domain;
}
```

#### Structured Logging with Exclusions

Use structured logging with explicit exclusion of sensitive fields:

```csharp
// Define a sanitized version of the data for logging
var loggableData = new
{
    user.Id,
    EmailDomain = user.Email.Split('@').LastOrDefault(),
    HasPhoneNumber = !string.IsNullOrEmpty(user.PhoneNumber),
    City = user.Address?.City,
    State = user.Address?.State,
    // Exclude other sensitive fields
};

_logger.LogInformation("User profile updated: {@UserData}", loggableData);
```

## Log Access Controls

### Log Storage Security

1. **File System Permissions**
   - Log files should have restricted permissions
   - Only the application and administrators should have access
   - Example for Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/log/furryfriends
     sudo chmod 750 /var/log/furryfriends
     ```

2. **Database Logging Security**
   - If logs are stored in a database, use proper access controls
   - Consider encrypting sensitive log entries
   - Implement row-level security if available

3. **Cloud Storage Security**
   - When using cloud storage for logs (e.g., Azure Blob Storage):
     - Use private access only
     - Enable encryption at rest
     - Set up appropriate access policies
     - Consider using SAS tokens with expiration

### Log Transmission Security

1. **Server-to-API Communication**
   - Always use HTTPS for transmitting logs from the server to the API
   - Consider adding additional authentication for the logging endpoint
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks

2. **Log Aggregation Security**
   - If using a log aggregation service:
     - Use secure transport protocols
     - Authenticate log shippers
     - Encrypt sensitive log data

## Audit Logging

### Security Events to Log

The following security-related events should always be logged:

1. **Authentication Events**
   - Login attempts (successful and failed)
   - Password changes
   - Account lockouts
   - Session timeouts

2. **Authorization Events**
   - Access denied events
   - Privilege escalation
   - Role changes

3. **Data Access Events**
   - Access to sensitive client or pet data
   - Bulk data exports
   - Changes to critical data

### Audit Log Format

Audit logs should include:

1. **Who**: User identifier
2. **What**: Action performed
3. **When**: Timestamp with timezone
4. **Where**: Source (IP, device)
5. **Result**: Success/failure

Example:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-05-01T12:34:56.789Z",
  "level": "Information",
  "messageTemplate": "User {UserId} {Action} {Resource} from {IpAddress}",
  "properties": {
    "UserId": "user-123",
    "Action": "viewed",
    "Resource": "client-456",
    "IpAddress": "192.168.1.1",
    "Result": "Success",
    "CorrelationId": "abc-123-def-456"
  }
}
```

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR Compliance

1. **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**
   - Have a process to remove personal data from logs when requested
   - Consider log retention policies that automatically delete old logs

2. **Data Minimization**
   - Only log what is necessary
   - Regularly review logging practices to ensure compliance

3. **Purpose Limitation**
   - Only use logs for their intended purpose (debugging, monitoring, security)
   - Document the purpose of different types of logs

### Industry-Specific Compliance

1. **HIPAA (if applicable to pet health data)**
   - Ensure logs with pet health information are properly secured
   - Implement appropriate access controls and audit trails

2. **PCI DSS (if handling payment information)**
   - Never log full credit card numbers or CVV codes
   - Mask PAN (Primary Account Number) when logging is necessary
   - Implement strict access controls for logs that might contain payment data

## Incident Response

### Log-Related Security Incidents

1. **Log Tampering Detection**
   - Implement checksums or digital signatures for log integrity
   - Regularly check for gaps in log sequences
   - Consider write-once logging mechanisms

2. **Excessive Access to Logs**
   - Monitor and alert on unusual access patterns to log storage
   - Implement least privilege for log access

3. **Log Data Leakage**
   - Have a response plan for if log data is accidentally exposed
   - Include logs in data classification and data loss prevention strategies

### Using Logs During Incidents

1. **Log Preservation**
   - During security incidents, preserve logs as evidence
   - Implement a log backup strategy for incident investigation

2. **Log Analysis for Incident Response**
   - Train security personnel on log analysis techniques
   - Have tools ready for quick log analysis during incidents

## Recommendations for FurryFriends

1. **Implement a Log Sanitization Service**
   - Create a centralized service for sanitizing logs
   - Use consistent masking patterns across the application

2. **Regular Log Audits**
   - Periodically review logs for sensitive information
   - Update logging practices based on findings

3. **Log Monitoring**
   - Implement automated monitoring for security events
   - Set up alerts for suspicious patterns

4. **Documentation and Training**
   - Document secure logging practices for developers
   - Train team members on proper logging techniques
