# FurryFriends Logging Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the logging architecture implemented in the FurryFriends application. The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns between client-side and server-side components, ensuring that the Blazor WebAssembly client does not make direct HTTP calls to external APIs.

## Summary of Changes

The following changes were made to the logging architecture:

1. **Fixed the Client-Side Logging Service**:
   - Removed direct HTTP calls from the client-side implementation
   - Created a lightweight client-side logging service that only logs locally
   - Properly registered the service in the client's DI container

2. **Implemented a Server-Side Logging Service**:
   - Created a server-side logging service that handles HTTP communication with the backend
   - Configured the service to send logs to the backend API
   - Registered the service in the server's DI container

3. **Added a Backend API Endpoint for Logging**:
   - Created a new FastEndpoints endpoint to receive logs from the server
   - Configured the endpoint to process and store logs appropriately

4. **Fixed Dependency Issues**:
   - Resolved ambiguous references to the IClientLoggingService interface
   - Ensured proper namespace usage across the application

## Best Practices

These changes follow the best practices for Blazor hybrid applications:

- The Blazor WebAssembly client no longer makes direct HTTP calls to external APIs
- The Blazor Server component handles all communication with the backend
- The architecture maintains a clean separation of concerns
- Logging failures are handled gracefully and don't break the application
- Logs are properly written to files in the Logs directory
