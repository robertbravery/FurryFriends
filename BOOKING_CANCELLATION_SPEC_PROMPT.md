## üìù Detailed Specification Prompt

**Feature Name**: Booking Cancellation

**Feature Description**:
Add comprehensive booking cancellation functionality to the FurryFriends platform that enables both clients and pet walkers to cancel existing bookings. The system must enforce business rules around when bookings can be cancelled, maintain an audit trail of all cancellations, and provide appropriate user feedback.

**Key Requirements to Address**:

1. **Cancellation Eligibility**
   - Determine which booking statuses allow cancellation (e.g., Pending, Confirmed but not Started)
   - Prevent cancellation of completed bookings
   - Prevent cancellation of already-cancelled bookings
   - Define any time-based restrictions (e.g., must cancel X hours before booking start)

2. **User Permissions**
   - Who can cancel a booking? (Client only, Pet Walker only, or both?)
   - Can an admin/system cancel bookings?
   - Should there be different cancellation workflows for different user types?

3. **Cancellation Workflow**
   - What happens when a booking is cancelled? (Status change, notifications, etc.)
   - Should cancellation reasons be captured?
   - Should there be a confirmation step before cancellation?

4. **Data & Audit Trail**
   - Track who cancelled the booking and when
   - Store cancellation reason (if applicable)
   - Maintain booking history for analytics
   - Should cancelled bookings be soft-deleted or hard-deleted?

5. **Business Rules & Constraints**
   - Are there any penalties or restrictions for frequent cancellations?
   - Should cancellation be allowed within X hours of booking start?
   - Any refund-related considerations for future payment integration?

6. **User Experience**
   - How should users initiate cancellation? (Button, menu option, etc.)
   - What confirmation/warning messages should be shown?
   - Should users receive confirmation of successful cancellation?

7. **Error Handling**
   - What error messages for invalid cancellation attempts?
   - How to handle race conditions (simultaneous cancellation attempts)?
   - What if booking is deleted while cancellation is in progress?

## üí° Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific About Your Business Rules**
   - If you have specific cancellation windows (e.g., "must cancel 24 hours before"), include them
   - If certain user types have different permissions, clarify that

2. **Consider Your Current System**
   - You already have Booking, Client, and PetWalker entities
   - Think about how cancellation fits into your existing booking lifecycle

3. **Think About Future Features**
   - Cancellation will eventually tie into payment/refunds
   - Consider how cancellation reasons might be used for analytics

4. **Review the Generated Spec**
   - Look for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
   - Clarify any ambiguous requirements before moving to planning phase

- GET /petwalker/{id}/available-slots - Check availability

**Current Booking Statuses** (inferred from codebase):
- Pending
- Confirmed
